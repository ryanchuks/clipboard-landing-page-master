## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Transform

### Continued development

I'll like to develop more on using CSS Transform and try out CSS Animation. I'll love to enhance my CSS styling from all ramification

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me in understanding more on all there is to know about HTML and CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This as well serves as a good guide on any area that may seen confusing with HTML and CSS.
